 **Choosing your development environment**

You need a platform to develop your new system on. Following the trends of general computing, the two most popular are Windows and GNU/Linux. Developers using a GNU/Linux system have a slight advantage in availability of tools, but this can be solved on Windows using a system such as Cygwin.

    Binutils: Fundamental tools for manipulation of object files.
    GCC: The GNU Compiler Collection. GCC contains compilers for C, C++, Fortran and Ada, amongst others.
    Make: For automating the build process, which becomes really helpful once you have more than a handful of files.
    Grep and sed: For doing more powerful searches and search and replaces (helpful when filling out tables with data).
    Diffutils: Incredibly useful for showing the differences between two files.
    Perl or Python: One of these two scripting languages should be installed. Useful for string manipulation, amongst other things. Perl used to be the recommendation, but Python is now quite mature, and is possibly easier to learn. Both have hundreds of packages/modules available for doing various tasks.
    An editor: For writing your Assembly, C and other (code) files.
